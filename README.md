## Outline / Notes

*  I like the idea of this being a simple lab. It can have them layout various views in Interface Builder constraining squares to the corner of the screen possibly with labels in the center of those views that contain some word. Maybe it's them remaking the layout of Simon Says but this time using Auto Layout (where before we had turned off Auto Layout so they didn't have to worry about adding constraints.

* Maybe it doesn't have to be too easy, but considering this will be their first time messing around with a not so easy concept--I don't mind it reinforcing what we just talked about with a bit of a challenge
